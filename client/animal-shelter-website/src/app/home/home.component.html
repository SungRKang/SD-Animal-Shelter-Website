            <p>
                We are a nonprofit dog rescue operating out of the Camp Bow Wow in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Since we are a nonprofit, we survive on our donations and adoption fees and the goodwill of all our supporters. Prior to housing dogs in the rescue, we have worked with other local rescues to help rehome dogs. In 2015, we were able to create our own rescue and since then have adopted out over 1000 dogs! These dogs were all considered not adoptable because they didnâ€™t pass their initial evaluations at the shelter or they were on a euthanasia list because the shelter was too full.

So far the rescue is still trying to figure out where I’m at with all those things but they can tell that I love people and children. Dogs can be a bit difficult for me to work with. It just depends if our vibes be vibing. One of the main things I do love to do is go on walks and man will I run and play.

      "description" : "My name is Dante and I came all the way from Kansas City to find a home in this amazing state. Coming into the rescue they have been teaching me commands like sit and off. Sometimes I don't understand the off part, but once I calm down I will lay there at your feet soaking in any love you can give me. My favourite things to do are play with other dogs, go on walks, and play with toys. If you're looking for a companion who is a quick learner and desire to please look no further than me!"
